        <p>Learn about the machines and how to make beautiful products</p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Precious Plastic have created four machines to recycle plastic. The machines are designed based on traditional industrial concepts but on a much smaller scale so that costs and knowledge's entry level can be kept to a minimum. This inclusive approach increases accessibility and adoption worldwide.</p>
        
        <p>The machines are developed using basic technologies and materials so they are easily understood, reproduced and repaired by people from all over the world with basic metal and building skills. The machines are also built in a modular way meaning that each part is independent and can be replaced, improved, changed, repaired and maintained individually without affecting the overall machine.</p>
        
        <h3>How it works</h3>
        <p>The underlying principle behind the machines is the same for all of them, except the shredder. The machines apply heat to plastic, plastic melts, gets pressed into a mould or shape and is finally cooled to regain its solid state. That's all the magic behind recycling. Pretty simple, right? Each machine is unique with its own workflows, outcomes, precautions, behaviours and problems but the fundamental concept is the same. The more you'll work with them, the more you'll understand them and get better at recycling.</p>

        <h2>How to get started</h2>
        <p>Working with plastic is not easy, it takes time and dedication - just like any other craft. It is important you first learn about plastic, the way it behaves and works under different conditions. In the early days of your journey into plastic you should get a feeling of how it melts, how it cools, when it burns and why or how to polish and finish it to make great products.</p>
        
        <p>Before getting started there are a few general things that apply to all machines to take into account:</p>
        
        <h3>1. Read the manual</h3>
        <p>If you are new to Precious Plastic and recycling always give a full read to this manual. It contains key information about plastic and the machines. This will save you time, help you get the best products, not break the machines as well as keep yourself safe and healthy.</p>
        
        <h3>2. Safety</h3>
        <p>A number of international research papers have been written on the safety of working with plastic. Opinions are often in contrast on whether heating plastic is dangerous or not. Many researches show that keeping the temperature of the plastic within the melting zone (not burning it) isn't harmful. This also depends greatly on which plastic type you are working with (this is why sorting is so important).</p>
        
        <p>The machines work at few hundreds degrees and require people operating them to be always very focused and concentrated to avoid burning or set stuff on fire. Particular attention should also be kept at all times when working with the shredder as its blades are sharp and tend to grab things. Never work with long sleeves or loose gloves with the shredder.</p>
        
        <h3>3. Choose your plastic and start easy</h3>
        <p>There are many plastic types to choose from. Each having their own properties and behaviours (flexible, hard, liquid etc.). A few are easier to work with because, amongst other things, they have a longer melting zone. We suggest to start with PP, HDPE, PS since they are much easier to work with and will make your life a lot easier.</p>
        
        <h3>4. Temperature</h3>
        <p>With every recycling process, the first step is to figure out which temperature is needed to melt the plastic. Most of the time this depends on the plastic type you are working with and the room temperature at which you're operating. Don't be surprised if sometimes the recommended melting temperature does not achieve the desired molten state, try to gradually adjust your temperature up or down until you achieve the desired melting.</p>
        
        <h3>5. Do not burn plastic</h3>
        <p>This might seem obvious for some but worth repeating. Plastic should never be burned, at home or while working with Precious Plastic. Fumes from burning plastic are highly toxic and can cause serious health issues to humans. For the recycling process it is also extremely bad practice to burn plastic as the resulting products will be damaged or lower quality.</p>
        
        <h3>6. Moulds</h3>
        <p>Moulds are an integral part of the Precious Plastic ecosystem and could almost be considered a world on its own. Moulds give shape to the molten plastic and create the final product. We advise to spend some quality time thinking, designing and making an accurate mould so you can create better products.</p>
        
        <h3>7. Make plastic valuable</h3>
        <p>We believe plastic should not be seen as disposable and cheap. We strive to make plastic valuable, create objects that last long and that people cherish. Creating beautiful, more expensive and valuable objects will avoid you having to compete with dancing cheap oil prices - people will buy your products because they want it, not because they are cheap.</p>
        
        <h3>8. Share your creations back</h3>
        <p>Our community is the backbone of the project. Go to our forums or website to see things made by others and make sure to share back the things you make. Help to fuel the project forward! Together we can find a solution to the plastic problem that works, is fun and improves everyone's life.</p>

                <h3>Shredder</h3>
                <p>The shredder machine is a key element for a fully functional Precious Plastic workspace. The shredder enables you to chop bigger plastic objects into smaller flakes that are easier to store, wash and introduce in the other machines.</p>

                <h3>Extrusion Machine</h3>
                <p>The extrusion machine is a very powerful machine as it can create unique products and can run continuously. With the extrusion machine you can create filament, granulate or get creative working with moulds.</p>

                <h3>Injection Machine</h3>
                <p>The injection machine is a rather fast machine that allows for small productions of very precise objects. Moulds can be slightly harder to make but once you have a good mould you will be amazed by the products you can create.</p>

                <h3>Compression Machine</h3>
                <p>The compression machine allows you to make larger flat sheets that can be used in a variety of applications, from furniture to construction. It's perfect for creating larger items from recycled plastic.</p>

        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>The above processes are a starting point, not an end goal. They should inspire you and get you started, spend some time mastering them. Once you're confident you understand how they work and how to work with plastic why not trying to go off road and test new ideas, moulds, processes and techniques?</p>
        
        <p>We look forward to see where you and your team can take this project, pushing the limits of plastic recycling.</p>
